    <p class="text">An adventure is an exciting experience or undertaking that is typically bold, sometimes risky. Adventures may be activities with danger such as traveling, exploring, skydiving, mountain climbing, scuba diving, river rafting, or other extreme sports. Adventures are often undertaken to create psychological arousal or in order to achieve a greater goal, such as the pursuit of knowledge that can only be obtained by such activities.</p>

      <h2 class="desc">BIKING</h2></div>
      <P class="text"> It is a kind of adventure sport which takes a lot of sweat and effort to reach the desirable destination. This jaggy yet bumpy ride that is nothing less than a staple for the adventurers can be best experienced on India's rough roads. Mountain biking is part of adventure tourism that has been running with full force in India.
        It's not simple to take your bike wherever you want. You just can't ride it anywhere and everywhere. Mountain biking is a kind of adventure sport which can be enjoyed far off the roads, often of rugged hills and terrains. India caters to all the needs one is looking for to get out of the city life and indulge into nature's beauty.</P>

      <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2></div> 
      <p class="text">Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but can also be found as standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave pools.</p>
